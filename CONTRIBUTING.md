## How to help, improve or test it

- create a new branch from the main branch, try to use "semantical" names like:
  - feature/\*
  - fix/\*
  - docs/\*
  - test/\*

- Open a PR back to the main branch. _**Direct commits to main are not allowed.**_

### The development flow:

It looks like TBD (Trunk Based Development).

### The test phase

Need to be created, for now is just the old and good get the code and test the function localy, so avoid big changes.
